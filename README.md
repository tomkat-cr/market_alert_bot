- **Automation**: `make`

## Getting Started

Follow these instructions to get a local copy up and running for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following software installed on your system:

- [Python 3.13](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/)
- [Make](https://www.gnu.org/software/make/)
- [Node.js 20](https://nodejs.org/)
- [flyctl](https://fly.io/docs/hands-on/install-flyctl/) (for deployment)

### Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/tomkat-cr/market_alert_bot.git
    cd market_alert_bot
    ```

2.  **Set up your environment variables:**

    Create a `.env` file by copying the example file. You will need a Telegram Bot Token from BotFather.
    ```sh
    cp .env-example .env
    ```
    Then, edit the `.env` file and add your token:
    ```
    TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN=YOUR_TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN
    ```

3.  **Install dependencies:**

    The `install` command will set up everything you need to run the bot.
    ```sh
    make install
    ```

4. **Dependencies update**

    Over the time, you may need to update the dependencies, specially to get covered from vulnerabilities. Run this command:

    ```bash
    make update
    ```

## How to use the BOT

- Go to [Telegram](https://telegram.org/) and search for: `ocr_marketalert`
- Double click on the `@ocr_marketalert_bot` entry
- Click on the `Start` link at the bottom of the chat section.
- Use `/help` to get the command list.

## How to deploy to fly.io

Create the BOT on Telegram:

- Go to [Telegram](https://telegram.org/)
- Search for: `botfather`
- Double click on the `@botfather` entry
- Click on the `Start` link at the bottom of the chat section.
- Use `/newbot` command to create the BOT.
- Follow on-screen instructions to assign a BOT user name, BOT name, etc. Please use a different name than `@ocr_marketalert_bot` ;)
- That the end of the process, copy the Telegram BOT Token and store it in a secure place.

Create the .env file:

- Run this command:

```bash
cp .env-example .env
```

- Edit the `.env` file and paste the Telegram BOT Token on the `TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN` variable.

Create the App on [Fly.io](https://fly.io) by running this command:

```bash
sh run_fly_io.sh create_app
```

Finally deploy it running this command:

```bash
sh run_fly_io.sh deploy
```

NOTE:<br/>
The `api/Dockerfile` has the magic to run the BOT on [Fly.io](https://fly.io). It creates a docker container with python setup, perform a `pip install` and run `python index.py`. That's the way Fly.io works.<br/><br/>

## BOT local running in Polling mode

Use the Polling mode when you can use a server that allow constant running of the python app.

- Edit the `.env` file and un-comment this line:

```
# RUN_MODE=cli
```

- Run these commands:

```bash
sh run_fly_io.sh run
```

## BOT local running in Webhook mode

Use the Webhook mode when you need to deploy the BOT as a serverless function.

- Edit the `.env` file and comment this line by adding a `#` as a first character:

```
RUN_MODE=cli
```

- Run these commands:

```bash
npm install --also=dev
sh run_fly_io.sh run_ngrok
```

- A screen like this will appear:

```
Session Status                online
Session Expires               1 hour, 52 minutes
Version                       2.3.40

Web Interface                 http://127.0.0.1:4040
Forwarding                    http://6272-190-73-192-124.ngrok.io -> http://localhost:8000
Forwarding                    https://6272-190-73-192-124.ngrok.io -> http://localhost:8000
```

- Copy se URL in the second `Forwarding`.
- Open a new Terminal window.
- Change the current directory to the one with the cloned repo `cd ./market_alert_bot`
- Run this command replacing `[FORWARDING_URL]` with the URL copied in a previous step:

```bash
sh run_fly_io.sh run_webhook [FORWARDING_URL]
```

- Go to Telegram and test your BOT.
